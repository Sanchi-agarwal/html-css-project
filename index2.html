      <h2>Why Are Young People at Risk?</h2>
      <p>Heart attacks were once considered a health issue for the elderly. But in recent years, more cases have been reported among people under 40. This alarming trend calls for greater awareness and preventive action.</p>

      <h3>Major Causes</h3>
      <p>Several lifestyle and environmental factors contribute to this rise in cardiovascular events:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>High stress levels from work or studies</li>
        <li>Poor diet rich in processed and fast foods</li>
        <li>Lack of physical activity</li>
        <li>Smoking and alcohol abuse</li>
        <li>Undiagnosed genetic factors or pre-existing conditions</li>
      </ul>
